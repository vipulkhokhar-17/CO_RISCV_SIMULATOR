RISC-V Assembler and Simulator

Overview
This project implements a simplified RISC-V assembler and simulator as part of a Computer Organization course. The assembler converts RISC-V assembly instructions into 32-bit binary machine code, and the simulator executes this binary code while emulating register and memory behavior.

The project provides a clear understanding of how high-level assembly instructions are translated and executed at the hardware level.

PROJECT STRUCTURE

## Assembler

### Functionality
The assembler reads RISC-V assembly instructions and converts them into 32-bit binary instructions according to the RISC-V ISA specification.

### Supported Instruction Types
- **R-type**: add, sub, and, or, xor, etc.
- **I-type**: addi, lw, jalr, etc.
- **S-type**: sw
- **B-type**: beq, bne, blt, bge
- **U-type**: lui, auipc
- **J-type**: jal

### Key Features
- Parses registers, immediates, and instruction mnemonics
- Handles label resolution for branch and jump instructions
- Generates correct opcode, funct3, funct7, and immediate fields
- Produces 32-bit binary machine code output


## Simulator

### Functionality
The simulator executes the binary machine code generated by the assembler and mimics the working of a RISC-V processor.

### Components Simulated
- **Register File**: 32 general-purpose registers (x0–x31), with x0 hardwired to zero
- **Program Counter (PC)**: Tracks the current instruction address
- **Memory**: Supports load and store operations

### Execution Cycle
The simulator follows the standard instruction cycle:
1. Fetch instruction from memory using PC
2. Decode instruction fields
3. Execute the instruction
4. Update registers, memory, and PC accordingly


## How to Run

## Step 1: Run the Assembler
```bash
python3 Assembler.py <assembly_input_file >

This generates a file containing the corresponding binary machine code.
To run the simulator,
python3 Simulator.py <binary_input_file>
